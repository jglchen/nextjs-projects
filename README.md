# Build Applications from Website to Mobile - A Sample Server-Rendered Website with Node.js

This is a **[next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** framework site as a sample server-rendered illustration.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. For demonstration purposes, in this site we predominantly employ Static Generation to pre-render pages.
Therefore **getStaticProps** are employed to fetch the data into pages, **getStaticPaths** are used to generate pages with dynamic routes. This site illustrates **John Chen's** side projects for publicity to show up his technical capabilities and interests.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/nextjs-projects) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
