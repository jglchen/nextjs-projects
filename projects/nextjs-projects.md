Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. For demonstration purposes, in this site, we predominantly employ Static Generation to pre-render pages.
Therefore **getStaticProps** are employed to fetch the data into pages, **getStaticPaths** are used to generate pages with dynamic routes.

We employ **the next.js framework** described above to illustrate **John Chen's** side projects for publicity to show up his technical capabilities and interests.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered for the personal site. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through **[the Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/nextjs-projects)** as above with **[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)** app.
