Demonstrate an app using fundamentals of React including simple and class components, state, props, and submitting form data to add new data or update existing records. Users can freely **add** characters to the table, then they can **remove** any character from the table or **edit** any specific data record.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through **[the Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/react-app-demo)** as above with **[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)** app.
