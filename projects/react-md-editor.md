A Markdown editor app with **React.js** is built to facilitate editing Markdown documents. The **WYSIWYG** editor allows users who may be less experienced with Markdown to use familiar toolbar buttons and shortcuts. In addition, the HTML output is shown simultaneously when editing Markdown documents.

Markdown is not a syntax that an average user will be familiar with, nor is it visually clear while editing. In other words, for an unfamiliar user, the syntax they write will make little sense until they view the result. This app has been designed to bridge this gap for non-technical users who are less familiar with or just learning Markdown syntax.

**Responsive web CSS designs** are adopted for the app, this makes the app looks good on all devices. **iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through **[the Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/md-editor)** as above with **[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)** app.
