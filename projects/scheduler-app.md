This is an appointment scheduler app for demonstrations. Once you sign up for this app, you can set up scheduled activities in the app for you. You can list the meeting targets with their email addresses and ask the app to send confirmation emails for a meeting appointment.

Users can quickly check their scheduled activities while browsing calendars, and then select a single date or date ranges to list out all the scheduled activities in the selected period.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/scheduler-app) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
